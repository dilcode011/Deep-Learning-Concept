# 🚀 Pretrained Models & Advanced Architectures

**Prerequisites:** [Deep Learning & CNN Basics (LeNet)](02_CNN_Mechanics/Architecture/README.md)

---

## 📖 Overview
Building upon the foundational CNN concepts (like LeNet-5) covered in my previous modules, this repository focuses on **Transfer Learning** and **State-of-the-Art Architectures**.

Instead of training models from scratch, we leverage **Pretrained Models**—networks trained on massive datasets (ImageNet, Wikipedia)—to solve complex problems with higher accuracy and less data.
