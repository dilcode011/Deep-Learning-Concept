# 🧠 Deep Learning Concepts & Experiments

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository serves as a collection of my hands-on experiments and study notes on Deep Learning architectures. The goal is to isolate specific concepts (like CNN arithmetic, Vanishing Gradients, or Activation Functions) and demonstrate how they work mathematically and programmatically using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

## 📂 Contents

| Notebook File | Topic | Key Concepts Demonstrated |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `CNN_Padding_Strides_Demo.ipynb` | **CNN Mechanics** | Padding (`valid` vs `same`), Strides, and Pooling layers. |
| *(Future uploads)* | ... | ... |
