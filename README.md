# 🧠 Deep Learning Concepts & Experiments

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository serves as a collection of my hands-on experiments and study notes on Deep Learning architectures. The goal is to isolate specific concepts (like CNN arithmetic, Vanishing Gradients, or Activation Functions) and demonstrate how they work mathematically and programmatically using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Deep-Learning-Experiments.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Deep-Learning-Experiments.git)
    ```
2.  Open the desired notebook in **Jupyter** or **Google Colab**.
3.  Run the cells to view the `model.summary()` outputs and observe the shape transformations.
